# README for `final_neuro_lab.ipynb`

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook, `final_neuro_lab.ipynb`, is a comprehensive script used for conducting various neural network experiments. The notebook is structured to facilitate testing multiple models on different datasets to evaluate their performance and effectiveness.

## Structure of the Notebook
The notebook is divided into multiple sections, each dedicated to a different aspect of the neural network experimentation process:

- **Introduction**: Brief overview of the objectives and the theoretical background.
- **Data Preparation**: Steps for loading and preprocessing the data used in the experiments.
- **Model Building**: Code blocks for constructing different neural network models.
- **Experimentation**: Running experiments to train models and evaluate their performance.
- **Results Analysis**: Tools and plots for analyzing the performance of the trained models.
- **Conclusion**: Summary of findings and potential future work.

## Known Issues
Please note that there are known code errors in sections B2 and B3 of the notebook:
- **Accuracy Calculation Issue**: The accuracy metric that is returned in these sections reflects the cumulative performance across all models rather than providing a separate accuracy for each individual model tested. This may lead to misinterpretation of the performance of each model.

## Recommended Actions
- **Code Review**: A thorough review and debugging of the code in sections B2 and B3 are recommended to correct the accuracy calculation and ensure that individual performance metrics are correctly isolated and reported.

## Summary
The `final_neuro_lab.ipynb` notebook is designed for conducting extensive neural network experiments. It includes sections for data handling, model creation, and result analysis. Users should be aware of the accuracy calculation error in sections B2 and B3 and take necessary steps to address this for accurate model evaluation. This notebook serves as a fundamental tool for understanding neural network behavior across various conditions and configurations.
